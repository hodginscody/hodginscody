    <h1>My Final Project</h1>
    <p>
        The goal of my CS601 Final Project is to give any end user a glimpse into
        the life of Cody Hodgins while showcasing the HTML, Javascript, CSS, JSON, and Vue
        skills I have learned in this course. My project consists of an 8-page website 
        about my life. The last page is a Knowledge Test which quizzes the user about elements
        of my life. Enjoy!
