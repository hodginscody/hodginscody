        My name is Cody Hodgins. I grew up in Holyoke, MA and received my Bachelor's
        in Applied Mathematics from American University. I worked for the White House
        Office of National Drug Control Policy programming with SAS, a statistics 
        software. Upon graduating, I was a programmer for Hampshire and
        Mount Holyoke College a few years after. I am now a software anaylyst for 
        Ellucian, the company that provides software to higher education
        institutions.

        In my free time, I sing and play the guitar. I am also a pilot working
        towards my Commercial License. My friends and I have built and programmed
        a flight simulator that is located at Westfield Barnes Regional Airport.
        We are in the process of gaining FAA approval for the simulator, in which
        case pilots can then log flight hours in the simulator towards their ratings,
        thus saving them time and money.
