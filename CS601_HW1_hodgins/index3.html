        I sing and play the guitar in a Top 40's band called 2TheTop. We have performed at various venues,
        including the Yankee Candle Village, Fourth of July celebrations, and private parties. My friend Sash' 
        and I started the band back in 2015, and we've added members since. We write and produce original music 
        as well as cover hits from popular artists such as:
        <ul>
            <li>Ed Sheeran</li>
            <li>Justin Timberlake</li>
            <li>The Weeknd</li>
            <li>The Backstreet Boys</li>
            <li>Phil Collins</li>
            <li>Prince</li>
        </ul>
        Feel free to listen to our original music on our <a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/2thetopofficial">Soundcloud page</a>.
