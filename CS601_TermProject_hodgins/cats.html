            <p>
                This is Baby. She likes to cuddle on the couch and come downstairs while I work.
                She loves to eat and will pretty much eat anything. Her favorite toy is the laser pointer
                and loves chasing after it. She dislikes being brushed for too long and does not like to
                be touched on her belly. She is very sweet, but just do not touch her in the wrong place
                or you may regret it.

            <p>
                This is Tiggy. He loves to cuddle and eat. He also loves his hair short and appreciates when
                we give him haircuts. He likes playing with the laser pointer, but loves chewing on strings likes
                shoelaces and sweatshirt straps. He loves laying in the sunlight and getting his tan on. Tiggy
                dislikes physical activity, though he does run up and downstairs on occasion and plays with the laser
                pointer. Tiggy is very loving and will never scratch or bite you.

            <img src="images/SchnitzelOnDesk.jpg" width="550" height="400" alt="My cat Schnitzel on my desk">
            <p>
                Last but not least, this is Schnitzel aka "Schnitzy". Schnitzy and Tiggy are twins. Schnitzy was such a special,
                wonderful cat. He was extremely smart and understood more than most animals. No one loved coming downstairs with me
                more than Schnitzy. He was like my little sidekick and would lay on the desk while I worked. He would 
                purposefully lay on the keyboard as well and stop me from working. He absolutely loved cuddling and his favorite
                toys were springs and other metal objects that made distinct noises. He loved licking plastic as well, which
                was always funny. We miss him very much and he will always have a special place in our hearts.
